# Forest fires prediction
My project aims to predict the extent of forest fires using meteorological data. Leveraging regression techniques and machine learning algorithms, I trained models on a comprehensive dataset containing variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. I employed various statistical measures and visualization techniques to explore the data's characteristics and relationships. The trained models were evaluated using cross-validation, and I selected the best-performing ones based on metrics like MAD and RMSE. To make the models accessible, I developed a Plumber API endpoint, enabling users to input meteorological parameters and receive predictions on the potential area affected by forest fires. Additionally, I applied post-processing techniques, including the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform, to enhance prediction accuracy. Overall, my project provides a comprehensive solution for predicting forest fire areas, contributing to proactive wildfire management and environmental conservation efforts
